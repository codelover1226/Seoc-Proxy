Welcome to the description about how to deploy the Seocromom proxy solution:

Before stating you may need to run: 'chmod +x setup-app.sh' and 'chmod +x setup-ssl.sh'

1- run the shell script in the debian folder ('seo-cromom-proxy/deployment/debian') by navigating to it and typing ./setup-app.sh

2- Link the different subdomains to the server's ip address. Namely for :
    - seocromom (this subdomain is used to connect to the admin dashboard and setup the proxy from a web interface)
    - spyfu (this subdomain is used to connect members to https://www.spyfu.com)
    - yourtext (this subdomain is used to connect members to https://yourtext.guru)
    - onehourindexing (this subdomain is used to connect members to https://onehourindexing.co)
    - sistrix (this subdomain is used to connect members to https://www.sistrix.com)
    - semrush (this subdomain is used to connect members to https://www.semrush.com)
    - majestic (this subdomain is used to connect members to https://majestic.com)
    - babbar (this subdomain is used to connect members to https://www.babbar.tech)

3- Now modify the file in 'seo-cromom-proxy/routes/sec/config.js' and replace the seoc-admin.localhost with the seocromom subdomain you choose in step 2

4- Now run the shell script named setup.sh in the folder 'seo-cromom-proxy/deployment/debian' by navigating to it and typing ./setup-ssl.sh

5- open your browser and type https://SEOCROMOM_SUB_DOMAIN/seoc/admin/temp-access.htm a page where you can enter the first parameter will show up. Fill in the form
and save them. A confirmation page will display the XYZ scripts you can use to integrate the app to an initial Wordpress site.

6- Run the shell script in step #4 to integrate the supplementary subdomains added in step 5
